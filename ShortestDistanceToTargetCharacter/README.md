Problem Statement
Given a string s and a target character target, find the shortest distance from each character in s to the nearest occurrence of target. The result should be an array where each index represents the shortest distance to target at that position.

Example

Input:
s = "EXPONENT"

target = "E"

Output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0]

Constraints:
The input string consists of uppercase letters.
The target character is guaranteed to appear at least once in s.
